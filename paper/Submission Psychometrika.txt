Va SCELTO tra queste due categorie di paper 

Theory and Methodology
Empirical studies will be considered only if they involve new or particularly interesting uses of quantitative techniques. Articles about the development and/or results of specific tests will generally not be considered.

Application Reviews and Case Studies
Application Reviews can be integrative, drawing together disparate methodologies for applications, or comparative and evaluative, discussing advantages and disadvantages of one or more methodologies in applications. Case Studies highlight methodology that deepens understanding of substantive phenomena through more informative data analysis, or more elegant data description.

dettaglòi submission (devo mettere un titolino prima dell'abstract)

1. Blind manuscript. The authors’ names must not appear in headers, on the same page as the abstract, or in authors’ notes anywhere in the body. If you are citing your own work you should cite it normally. Please remember to put the full title somewhere (before the abstract is a good place) because the cover sheet will not be distributed with the blinded manuscript.

2. Title page with the title, authors’ names and contact information. Any author notes regarding funding, etc. may be included on this page. If it's more than one page that's also fine.

What to submit: for a revised manuscript

1. Blind manuscript, as described above.

2. Title page, as described above.

3. Response to reviewer comments, explaining how you addressed them.
